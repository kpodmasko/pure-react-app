Pure react app.

The maing goal of this app is pure react without any libraries, even react-router and so one.

So you will not see webpack, sass too. Only babel to transpile jsx.

The task you can read in WSR_NC_2018_TP17_CLIENT_SIDE_3_4_MODULE.docx.

Also repo includes server, but it is not part of pure react app and it works with npm. I can say that it is not contain a lot of logic as it is stub for frontend;
